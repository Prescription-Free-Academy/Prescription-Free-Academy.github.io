Welcome to the academy library. Here you’ll find resources to support your learning and your involvement with the academy.

# Learning Initiatives

This page features all of the available learning initiatives from [Prescription Free Academy](https://prescriptionfree.academy/). They are set up using GitHub Repositories. There are links to the README to get started, the files themselves, the commit log and the issues (if any) for each repository.

It can be handy to bookmark this page. It’s updated as things change.

## Practice Projects

Gain experience creating real applications using web technologies. A great way to start pulling things together if you’ve already picked up some of the basics. Some are independent parts of our larger collaborative learning programs.

## Tasks for Coding Practice

Collections of practice tasks to improve your coding skills and start learning techniques to craft software.

**The Big Three: Arrays, Objects and Collections**    
[Currently in Production]

## Open Source Projects

Get involved in our open source projects. Very limited guidance here. Find your own way. Book a session with Nigel for help getting started if these seem interesting but you don’t know how to start.

**Open Fruit Machine**    
[README](https://github.com/pecknigel/open-fruit-machine/blob/main/README.md)

• [Issues](https://github.com/pecknigel/open-fruit-machine/issues)
• [Commits](https://github.com/pecknigel/open-fruit-machine/commits/main/)

## Contribute to the School

A great way to learn is to be involved in teaching others. Work with Nigel to help prepare learning materials while benefiting from free class time. Tasks will be chosen for you that suit what you’re currently learning.

Due to the nature of this work, it’s only available to committed learners who are already taking regular classes. Visit [Open Tasks](/open-tasks) to see what's currently planned.

## Collaborative Learning Programs

Our pièce de résistance. Gain experience in a real working environment lead by an experienced lead engineer. This is just getting started and we’re excited about the possibilities.

A second program is coming soon (building a web framework). All programs here require a substantial time commitment to get real value.

If you don’t have available a few hours minimum per week, a practice or open source project is likely a better choice.

## Trading Exchange

Work in a collaborative environment much like an asynchronous remote team. Build the software for a (fake) digital trading exchange.

### Implementations

These are current implementations. All just getting started (November, 2024). A good time to get involved in this long term  program. Great for the resume/CV if you’re looking to get a career going.

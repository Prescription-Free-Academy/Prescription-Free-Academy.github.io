# Educator Portal

We are all educators. At least of ourselves. Engaging with that can seriously upgrade your learning processes.

This area of the site is all about the approach that we take to learning and teaching.

It’s not intended to be comprehensive although in time it may be.

It’s not even necessarily intended for reading. There’s useful info here but it’s not necessarily easy to get at.

**Take what’s useful [to you], leave the rest.**

### All Bets Are Off

There’s no prescription here. The name wasn’t chosen by accident. Everyone learns their own way and that’s important. Creativity is important. The imagination is important.

If that’s lost or ignored, you’ll never be all that you can be. You’ll never be the software engineer that you could be.

It’s not about how you code, it’s about the way that you approach it. How you code is a product of *that*. And it needs to be your own.

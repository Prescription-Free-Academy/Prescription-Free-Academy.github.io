# Educator Portal

We are all educators. At least of ourselves. Engaging with that can seriously upgrade your learning.

This area of the site is all about the approach that we take to learning and teaching.

It’s not intended to be comprehensive although in time it may be.

It’s not even necessarily intended for reading. There’s useful info here but it’s not necessarily easy to get at.

If it seems interesting to you, have at it. Otherwise there’s a lot more interesting stuff elsewhere here.

**Take what’s useful [to you], leave the rest.**

Let’s get in to it.

## All Bets Are Off

There’s no prescription here. The name wasn’t chosen by accident. Everyone learns their own way and that’s important. Creativity is important. The imagination is important.

If that’s lost or ignored, you’ll never be all that you can be. You’ll never be the software engineer that you could be.

It’s not about how you code, it’s about the way that you approach it. How you code is a product of *that*. And it needs to be your own.

## Build from the Ground Up

## Get with the Program

It’s essential to stay engaged. You’re not going to learn by sitting back and being fed instructions. You’re going to have to make it happen yourself. This is not schooling.

## Master Task Switching



## Deliver on Your (Naming) Titles

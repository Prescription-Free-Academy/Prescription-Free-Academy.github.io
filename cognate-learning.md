# Cognate Learning

We’re all about the learning here.

One useful approach to learning software engineering skills can be to use a cognate approach.

> **cognate**
>
> 3\. Related or analogous in nature, character, or function.    

What’s this all about? I hear you say.

The idea is that you can improve the skills that help you to be a better software engineer by methods other than writing code.

Here are some ways that you can do that.

## Sharpen Your Mind

Brain Training apps like Elevate can help sharpen your mental abilities. It’s also fun and relaxing.

You can improve skills like attention, concentration, mental arithmetic and concentration.

## Write

Writing can improve skills that are used for software development. Imagination, creativity, drawing together information.

Journaling, creative writing, technical writing and others can all be highly beneficial to practice.

## Meditation

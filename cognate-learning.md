# Cognate Learning

We’re all about the learning here.

One useful approach to learning software engineering skills can be to use a cognate approach.

> **cognate**
>
> 3\. Related or analogous in nature, character, or function.    

What’s this all about? I hear you say.

The idea is that you can improve the skills that help you to be a better software engineer by methods other than writing code.

Here are some ways that you can do that.

## Sharpen Your Mind

Regular use of Brain Training apps like Elevate can help sharpen your mental abilities. It’s also fun and relaxing.

You can improve skills like attention, estimation, mental arithmetic and concentration.

## Writing

Writing can improve skills that are used for software development. Imagination, creativity, drawing information together.

Journaling, creative writing, technical writing and others can all be highly beneficial to practice.

## Meditation

Practicing meditation is excellent to improve your concentration, emotional state and other mental abilities.

All of which can help you to be a far more effective software engineer.

The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) site features comprehensive coverage of all front-end web technology. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and HTTP being the main contenders. It’s from the folks who create the Firefox web browser. Many of the links below are from MDN.

## Create a GitHub Pages Website

This can be great practice for working with web technologies. Jekyll is a simple and powerful system that’s easy to learn. GitHub Pages is a free and well designed system for easily using it. Improve many important skills. Not least Git itself.

## Create a Content API

Interested in learning to create APIs? Strapi is a great system for getting in to that. You can do everything with their admin interface (no coding) or customise everything with code to get more advanced.

This library site itself integrates Strapi with GitHub Pages to manage the Markdown for the content for the class notes and pattern collections.

It’s easy to get started. You can have an API going in less than an hour and build from there. Use it to create a back-end API for your front-end to use.

Integrate it with a Node.js command line script to generate HTML or Markdown for your site, practice with `fetch` to query the API, or whatever else you can think of.

# Software Engineering Patterns

This is an informal and original collection of design patterns used to engineer software.

Informal in the sense that not all may be formally recognisable as patterns. They’re useful approaches to achieving goals with software. There will be crossover and duplication between parts of patterns where it is useful to lay them out in that way.

Original in the sense that they have been named as seems appropriate and not written or organised with any existing system in mind.

References and collaborators will be cited.

This is all done in the spirit of learning and improving as software engineers. Comments are welcome and encouraged. GitHub Discussions coming soon.

It’s all a work in progress and intentionally creative and original in order to encourage innovation and showcasing useful points of view in original ways.

Of course, much or all of the material will be covered elsewhere in one form or another. It’s based on experience and what comes up while working with students.

## Engineering Patterns

These are patterns that are useful in day to engineering to get the job done in a reliable and consistent way. They’re intended as starting points and food for thought. To help you improve as a software engineer. There’s no right and wrong here. Just information. Use it as you see fit. Mix and match them. Augment them. Use bits of them. Find inspiration. Learn what’s useful and use it in the same way.

- Embed
- Include

Planned entries are listed but not linked.

## Entry-Level Patterns

These could also be called techniques but sit well as entry-level patterns. They’re the next steps for aspiring engineers after learning the basics. Along with building software of course, and these are building blocks for software.

- Varied Function
- Single Object Param
- Class
- Negation
- Chained Logic
- Fall Through Case/Implied Case (return/condition)
- Validation Return
- Quiet Return
- Three-Step Routine (Initialise, Process, Finish)
- Switch Case
- Map
- Filter
- Reduce
- JSON Storage
- Web Storage
- .env
- .inc
- Verified Get
- Verified Set
- Try-Throw-Catch

Planned entries are listed but not linked.

## Architecture Patterns

These are listed last because they are generally well covered elsewhere. They’ll be worked on in the same original way but are not being prioritised at this point.

- Factory
- Singleton
- Event Bus
- Dependency Injection
- Reactive Programming

Planned entries are listed but not linked.

# Software Engineering Patterns

This is an informal and original collection of design patterns used to engineer software.

Informal in the sense that not all may be formally recognisable as patterns. They’re useful approaches to achieving goals with software. There will be crossover and duplication between parts of patterns where it is useful to lay them out in that way.

Original in the sense that they have been named as seems appropriate and not written or organised with any existing system in mind.

References and collaborators will be cited.

This is all done in the spirit of learning and improving as software engineers. Comments are welcome and encouraged. GitHub Discussions coming soon.

It’s all a work in progress and intentionally creative and original in order to encourage innovation and showcasing useful points of view in original ways.

Of course, much or all of the material will be covered elsewhere in one form or another. It’s based on experience and what comes up while working with students.

# Tenets of Software Engineering

A.k.a. 101 tenets. Or at least it’s looking like getting towards that.

These are tenets to guide and assist you on your way to becoming an accomplished software engineer.

## It’s Not About How to Code

Of course that’s involved, but the real skill is in learning to craft software that’s reliable, maintainable, robust and coherent.

A lot more to say on this.

## Sharpen Your Research Skills

Search well. Check your effectiveness. Take a moment to look over the results. Stay away from low quality resources.

Follow links. Sites like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) have extensive cross referencing. Mostly in the form of contextual links.

Follow them! You don’t need to read the whole thing. Just scan it and read what’s useful. Then go back to where you were and keep going.

## Make Use of Learning Resources

MDN Web Docs has great resources. It’s not the only site, but it’s fairly comprehensive and well put together. It’s peer reviewed by hundreds of great folks who really know their stuff and want to produce accurate info for its own sake. Just because it’s needed. No business interests involved.

Get to know their guides. Get to know the format of their resources. Follow through the curriculum or at least review it. Add “mdn” when you’re searching for a reference on any part of HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

When you’re searching for more general info, skip adding “mdn”. There’s a lot of other good info out there too.

See our [Courses and Resources](/resources) for more sites to make use of.

## The Real Learning Starts When You Start Work

That’s why we focus our learning initiatives on being as close to a real working environment as it’s useful for them to be.

It’s not just about writing code. That’s probably not even half of it.

## Know What You Don’t Know

## Jack of All Trades, Master of Most

## It’s All About the Experience

For users, at least. It’s a different world. And one that you need to be intimately aware of if you’re designing interfaces and want to do it well.

## Modules, Interfaces, Modular Design

Pay attention to responsibilities.

## Test, Test, Test

## Write Clean Code, Master Debugging, Eliminate Frustration

## Delay Gratification

## Let Go!

It’s not a useful approach to try and get it all right the first time. Your focus is needed elsewhere.

## Breathe



## Not All of This is For You

Take what’s useful. Leave the rest.

## Master Debugging

It’s worth mentioning twice.

## Do One Thing At a Time (and Do It Well)

Stick anything you see on a list or add a TODO comment.

## The Three Step Process



## Pay Attention to Formatting



## Every Space (Character, Pixel) Matters!



## Manage Your Time Well



## There’s Nothing To Prove

Except to yourself? But we’re bored of cliches.

Aren’t we?

## It’s Just Water

Drink it. It really helps you think amongst countless other benefits.

Even better, add fresh lemon juice.

And no sugar!

## Take Regular Breaks



## Start from Where You Are



#% Rules Were Made For Bending

Breaking can also work.

## Sometimes Mistakes Are Worth Making



## Does It Really Matter?



## Stop and Look Around



## Observe Software



## Get to Know Your IDE

And make it WebStorm rather than VS Code. Or at least give it a good try.

## Learn Git

Use it for documentation as well as code. Contribute to open source projects. Learn GitHub features.

## Get Involved

Know the standards processes. Join newsletters. Check in on the W3C. Contribute to discussions.

## Master Task Switching



## Don’t Repeat Yourself



## Broaden Your Horizons

Try different libraries and frameworks. Get to know what’s out there. An hour or two can tell you a lot. Keep up with what’s out there.

## Deliver on Your Titles (Names)



## Pay Attention to Naming



## Master Data Structures



## Write Algorithms



## Consistency is Key



## Triangles Look Like Squares



## There’s More Than One Way To Do It



## It Depends



## Your Mileage May Vary



## Context is Everything



## Special by Default

A.k.a. Take care with everything that you do. If a job’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well. The devil is in the details. A job well done is its own reward.

## RTFM



## Really Look



## There’s No Need to Get Angry

A note on managing one’s emotions and state of mind.

## Precision of Language



## It’s Different, It Matters



## Wild Thing



## I Have My Own Mind For That, Thank You



## Is He Just Writing Titles That He’ll Never Expand Upon?



## Yes



## Possibly



## It’s Never Really Clear, Is It ?



## Don’t You Have AI To Help You With That?



## Be Straight With One Another

Talking about engineer to engineer. There’s no place for BS or power games or being right or getting offended. That’s if engineering effective and reliable software is your goal. Everyone needs to be on the same team. If not, best to stick to visiting the public house and leave the engineering to the grown-ups.

Learn to breathe. Learn to let go. Practice compassion. Learn to laugh. Practice humour.

## Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

Thanks, Larry.

## Isn’t this just a load of drivel?

Yes! Very much so. It’s only for if it’s useful. If it engages you. If you get something from it. Otherwise, yes, it’s just a load of drivel.

Move on.

Or was it, move along? I’ve always preferred that one.

Ahem.

## Only The Persistent Survive

Or was it “the stubborn”? Probably it’s both.

# Git

Git is an essential tool for any serious web developer, and useful for anyone working with code or even files in general. It’s a [version control system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). It enables you to collaborate with others developing software by tracking changes and providing facilities to resolve conflicts.

It also works well to use alone. Enabling you to write code with confidence, knowing that you can easily switch back to the last point that you committed your changes to the repository.

Git is commonly used with what’s termed a remote, which enables everyone to access the repository, along with backing up work as you go.

You can set up your own remote server, but it’s common to use a platform. Some popular ones are GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab. As well as providing a Git remote server, these platforms provide a whole host of useful features that work with or around your Git repository.

You may have heard of a “pull request” or PR for contributing code to projects. There’s a guided exercise to help learn what that’s all about. It’s a GitHub thing rather than Git itself.
